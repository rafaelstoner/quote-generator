Welcome to the Quote Generator project! This project is a part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in working with asynchronous functions, fetching data from APIs, and enhancing user experience through interactive features. The Quote Generator allows users to explore inspirational quotes, share them on Twitter, and generate new quotes with the click of a button.
